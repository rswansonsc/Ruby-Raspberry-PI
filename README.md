Getting Ruby on Rails to run on Raspberry PI device

This is where I will put notes on how to get Ruby on Rails to run on Raspberry_PI

Be sure to use a good fast SC memory card, if you look at the SD card you will notice a Class 4 or Class 8 which is really common. I would recommend you find a Class 10 memory card, if you plan to do any services like media stream, RubyOnRails, Apache Web, ect. I would recommend you find a Class 10 or better memory card.

I am doing testing on a 512mRAM, ModelB, Raspberry_PI unit

I have had some problems with memory, be sure you use the command 'free -h' it will show you the memory avaiable and used. Also you want to be sure you have your updates installed so be sure to run 'sudo apt-get update' so you have all your system updated installed.

Once you get your SD Ram setup the way you want be sure to make a copy and put into an image then place in a safe location, put it up on GitHub and share with everyone else. I will have an \images folder so you can look there to see what I have been able to get working.

Best wishes, happy coding, pull and update as you see errors in my write-up, thanks in advance.
